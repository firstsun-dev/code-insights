## Project Overview

**Code Insights** is a local-first analytics platform designed to turn AI coding sessions into actionable knowledge. It extracts structured insights, decisions, learnings, and prompt quality scores from tools like **Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI, Hermes Agent, OpenCode, Crush, and Google Antigravity**.

- **Purpose:** Help developers understand their AI coding patterns, track costs, and improve their AI fluency through automated session analysis and background processing.
- **Architecture:**
  - **`cli/`**: Node.js CLI (TypeScript) responsible for session discovery, parsing, and SQLite persistence. Includes a background **Analysis Queue** for asynchronous LLM processing.
  - **`server/`**: Hono-based API server (TypeScript) that proxies LLM requests, serves the dashboard, and manages the analysis worker.
  - **`dashboard/`**: React SPA (Vite + TypeScript) for visualizing sessions, analytics, cross-session patterns, and real-time analysis status.
- **Database:** Local SQLite database stored at `~/.code-insights/data.db`. Uses **WAL mode** for concurrent access and high-performance writes. See `RULES.md` for database integrity and engineering standards.

## Building and Running

The project uses `pnpm` workspaces for dependency management.

### Key Commands

- **Install Dependencies:** `pnpm install`
- **Build All Packages:** `pnpm build`
- **Run Tests:** `pnpm test`
- **CLI Usage:**
  ```bash
  code-insights sync           # Discover and import new sessions
  code-insights insights       # View or generate insights from the terminal
  code-insights queue          # Manage the background analysis queue
  code-insights reflect        # Generate cross-session synthesis (weekly/project)
  code-insights dashboard      # Start the web dashboard (default: localhost:7890)
  code-insights config         # Configure LLM providers and preferences
  ```
- **CLI Development:**
  ```bash
  cd cli
  pnpm dev                     # Watch mode for CLI
  npm link                     # Link code-insights command locally
  ```

## Development Conventions

- **Monorepo Management:** Uses `pnpm` workspaces. Always run `pnpm install` from the root.
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript usage. `cli/src/types.ts` is the **single source of truth**.
- **Database:** Uses `better-sqlite3`. Schema is defined in `cli/src/db/schema.ts`. V9 introduces the `analysis_queue` table for robust background processing. All persistence MUST use **WAL mode** (`PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL`).
- **SFL-Compliant Analysis:** The analysis pipeline (Session & Prompt Quality) enforces **Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL)** constraints.
  - **Structured Prompts:** Uses explicit XML boundaries (`<task>`, `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<output_schema>`) for deterministic LLM behavior.
  - **Rage Loop Detection:** Includes a pre-analysis heuristic (`loop-detector.ts`) to identify temporal loops and static token count stasis, flagged to the LLM as a dedicated friction category.
  - **Methodological Narratives:** Session summaries strictly forbid mechanical file listing; they must capture analytical methodology, power dynamics, and workflow milestones.
  - **SFL Breakdown:** Findings and takeaways include a mandatory `sfl_breakdown` (Ideational, Interpersonal, Textual) to log structural design choices.
  - **Dimension Scoring:** Scoring (0–100) is anchored by hard SFL constraints (0=catastrophic, 50=baseline, 100=flawless).
- **Analysis Queue:** Asynchronous job system for LLM tasks. Managed via `cli/src/db/queue.ts` and processed by `cli/src/analysis/queue-worker.ts`. Supports multi-level native fallbacks (Codex → Claude → Gemini).
- **Testing:** `vitest` is the primary test runner. Tests are in `__tests__/` directories adjacent to source.
- **Privacy:** Local-first. No session data is sent to the cloud except to user-configured LLMs for analysis.
- **Parsing:** Robust structural lookahead and `jsonrepair` for handling malformed LLM responses.
- **Hooks:** Automate sync and analysis via `code-insights install-hook`. Includes `session-end` hook for immediate background queueing.

## LLM Providers

Code Insights supports multiple providers for analysis and synthesis.

- **Native Runners:** Zero-config analysis using locally installed CLIs. Supports **Codex** (default native), **Claude Code**, and **Gemini CLI**. Features automatic usage-limit fallback: `Codex` → `Claude` → `Gemini`. **Updated:** Optimized native extraction to handle session-end hooks and background processing.
- **Supported Providers:** OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude 3.5), Google Gemini (2.0 Flash), OpenRouter, Mistral (Codestral), and Ollama (Local).
- **Dynamic Discovery:** Supports fetching latest models via `POST /api/config/llm/models`.
- **Cost Tracking:** Per-session and per-analysis cost tracking stored in `analysis_usage`.

## Provider Highlights

- **OpenCode:** Now features robust multi-schema support. Handles both legacy column-based storage and the latest JSON-in-SQLite `data` column format for messages and parts.
- **Sub-Agent Bundling:** Providers like `Gemini CLI` and `Hermes Agent` now align with a sub-agent model, recursively discovering and merging sub-agent interactions into the parent session for holistic analysis.
- **Background Sync:** The `ON CONFLICT` strategy in the database layer ensures that forced syncs (`--force`) correctly refresh message content and metadata from the source providers.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
